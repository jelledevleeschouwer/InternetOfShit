# InternetOfShit
An actual 'Internet of Shit' device. A smart toilet that connects over BLE with a smartphone app. The smartphone app scrapes the precipitation of the last week from a web service and with which the flush is optimized to not waste any water. The toilet paper level is also measured and displayed in the app such that you can change the toilet paper before you do your thing. The experience is enhanced with some aromatic perfumes when the person leaves the toilet.

# Requirements
